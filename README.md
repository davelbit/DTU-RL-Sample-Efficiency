# DTU-RL-Sample-Efficiency
This repository is used for the final project of the Deep Learning course at the Technical University of Denmark.

It contains an implementation of the state-of-the-art reinforcement algorithm SAC as well as a hyper-parameter tuning bench.

Further information on the algorithm, the implementation, and the experiments conducted for this project see the notebook ```evaluation.ipynb``` and the report in this repository.

To run the program one needs to run the main.py file with a GPU. It's is possible to change hyperparameters by defining flags.
